                    Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931 in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu. He was an aerospace scientist and the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He played a pivotal role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, which established India as a nuclear power. Known as the "Missile Man of India" for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology, Dr. Kalam inspired millions with his vision, humility, and dedication to the nation.
